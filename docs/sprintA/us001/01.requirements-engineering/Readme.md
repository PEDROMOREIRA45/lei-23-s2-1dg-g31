### 1.1. User Story Description


As an unregistered user, I want to display listed properties.


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>	The real estate agent reviews advertisement requests, registers the information in the system and publishes the offer so that it is visible to all clients who visit the agency and use the application. All registered information, except the agency commission, can be accessed by the client who intends to buy or rent the property; the client is, then, responsible for being able to consult the properties by type, number of rooms, and sort by criteria such as price or the parish where the property is located.





**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** Which is the unit of measurement used to estimate duration?
>  
> **Answer:** Duration is estimated in days.
